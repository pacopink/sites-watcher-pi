As SRE, you may have several web services to look after.
This program uses Raspberry Pi 3 Model B + NXEZ Swiss Army Knife board
to provide a solution to watch the availablity and delay level 
of your web services.

There is a 4-digit ditgital display, they are used to display the index
of the URL you configured in the 'config.py' file, theoretically you can 
watch 9999 URL, although it is not practical, but it is useful if you use 
it to watching some tens of URLs, each URL status will be displayed on the 
board for 1 second, when it is normal, the 8 leds will show the delay level:
1 led if <250 ms
2 led if <500 ms
3 led if <1000 ms
4 led if <1500 ms
5 led if <2000 ms
6 led if <3000 ms

If the URL response is timeout or does not meet the expectation, all 8 leds will
blink and the speaker will make a loud 'BeepBeepBeep' alarm.

To avoid long block when waiting for HTTP response, every request runs with a
3 seconds timeout, and a 16-thread thread pool is leveraged, as a result,
if the no. of threads in pool is greater than the URLs you are watching, the 
max blocking will be at max at predictable 3 seconds.

====================
When some watched service failed, you may want to set-off the beeper so that it
won't be too noisy to interupt your toubleshooting. this version use a beep_flag
to control this, when program starts up, beep_flag will read from dip_switch#2
to get the value, and you can change it by changing the dip_switch#2, when dip_switch#2
is 'ON', the beep alarm is on, vice versa.

Config:
edit config.py

Usage:
python main.py
